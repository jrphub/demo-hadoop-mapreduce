The Hadoop framework itself is mostly written in the Java programming language, with some native code in C and command line utilities 
written as shell scripts. Though MapReduce Java code is common, any programming language can be used with "Hadoop Streaming" to implement the "map" and "reduce" parts of the user's program. 
Other projects in the Hadoop ecosystem expose richer user interfaces.
